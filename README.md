Using React With Go Web Application

Run the Go server with this command: "go run ./cmd/server/main.go"
It also boots up the front-end from the current bundle in localhost:8080

For development purposes run the react dev environment with "npm start" in _ui folder. Create a release bundle to be added to Go binary with "npm run build" in the root of the project
